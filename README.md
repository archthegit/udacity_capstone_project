# udacity_capstone_project

In this capstone project, I will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order
sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the
general population. I will then identify the parts of the population that best describe the
core customer base of the company. Then, I will apply what Iâ€™ve learned on a third
dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the
company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into
becoming customers for the company
